        Parameters
        ----------
        n_features_to_select: int (default: 10)
            the number of top features (according to the relieff score) to
            retain after feature selection is applied.
        n_neighbors: int or float (default: 100)

            importance scores. If a float number is provided, that percentage of
            training samples is used as the number of neighbors.
            More neighbors results in more accurate scores, but takes longer.
        discrete_threshold: int (default: 10)
            Value used to determine if a feature is discrete or continuous.
            If the number of unique levels in a feature is > discrete_threshold, then it is
            considered continuous, or discrete otherwise.
        verbose: bool (default: False)
            If True, output timing of distance array and scoring
        n_jobs: int (default: 1)
            The number of cores to dedicate to computing the scores with joblib.
            Assigning this parameter to -1 will dedicate as many cores as are available on your system.
