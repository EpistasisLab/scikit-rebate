scikit-rebate is built on top of the following existing Python packages:

* NumPy

* SciPy

* scikit-learn

All of the necessary Python packages can be installed via the [Anaconda Python distribution](https://www.continuum.io/downloads), which we strongly recommend that you use. We also strongly recommend that you use Python 3 over Python 2 if you're given the choice.

NumPy, SciPy, and scikit-learn can be installed in Anaconda via the command:

```
conda install numpy scipy scikit-learn
```

Once the prerequisites are installed, you should be able to install scikit-rebate with a pip command:

```
pip install skrebate
```
You can retrieve basic information about your installed version of skrebate with the following pip command:

```
pip show skrebate
```

You can check that you have the most up to date pypi release of skrebate with the following pip command:

```
pip install skrebate -U
```
